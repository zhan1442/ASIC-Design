# ECE337-ASIC-Design-Laboratory
A repository for course ECE337: ASIC Design Laboratory(Spring2016). 

Introduction to standard cell design of VLSI digital circuits using VHDL hardware description language. Emphasis on how to write VHDL that will map readily to hardware. Laboratory experiments using commercial grade computer-aided design (CAD) tools for VHDL based design, schematic based logic entry, logic and VHDL simulation, automatic placement and routing, timing analysis and testing. 


Learning Objectives:
A student who successfully fulfills the course requirements will have demonstrated an ability to:

    design combinational and sequential logic in a variety of styles: schematic, structural, behavioral, and dataflow. Demonstrate and awareness of timing and resource usage associate with each approach.
    Use, modify, and create scripts to control the logic synthesis process.
    Create a test bench and use it to verify a design that incorporates multiple sequential blocks.
    Place, route, and verify timing of an ASIC design.
    Determine the RTL level architecture implied by HDL code of moderate complexity.
    Explain the difference between various ASIC and digital system design approaches -- standard cell, full custom, and programmable devices.
    Demonstrate a team based ASIC design process including a proposal, functional specification, hierarchical decomposition into modules, conduct of a design review, formal presentation, demonstration, and technical documentation.

Assessment Method for Learning Objectives: Outcomes i) iv) are demonstrated by completion of laboratory assignments specifically designed for these outcomes. A threshold completion score is specified for each lab assignment. Until the threshold is achieved, the outcome is not considered complete. Outcomes v) and vi) are demonstrated by means of written examination questions. Outcome vii) is demonstrated by in the context of a final team project. Each individual is required to make some significant contribution (as judged by course staff) for each aspect of the project described in the outcome.
