**WARN: (ENCEXT-1085):	Option 'rda_Input(ui_res_scale)' used in configuration file './encounter.conf' is obsolete. The name will be converted into new format automatically if design is saved and then restored. Alternatively, update the configuration file to use names 'rda_Input(ui_preRoute_res)' and/or 'rda_Input(ui_postRoute_res)' for resistance scale factors to be used at preRoute/postRoute stages of the design . The obsolete name works in this release. But to avoid this warning and to ensure compatibility with future releases, update this option name.

CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.
